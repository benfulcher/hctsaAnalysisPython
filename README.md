A beginner's attempt to work up analysis methods for [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) files in python.
The function `OutputToCSV` exports an hctsa .mat file as .csv data matrices, which can be read in and analyzed in python.
I will put code for new analyses here---feel free to contribute!
Also, my python is not great--would appreciate any tips!

Example:
```python3
    python umap_projection.py
```

Enjoy!
